/**
 * The five restoration bonus slots in their stored slot order.
 *
 * Slot order is semantic - Keep preserves the bonus family at each slot
 * position - so the slots are never sorted, grouped, or normalized to a
 * multiset for display, and the React key is the slot index because two slots
 * may legitimately hold the identical bonus.
 *
 * The slots are exposed as a labelled list, so assistive technology reads
 * five items rather than five loose chips. The wrapper is deliberately not a
 * `<ul>` / `<li>`: route step lists that contain these slots are `<ol>` items
 * of their own, and a nested `<li>` would be counted among them.
 *
 * `scope` selects the scope-specific Master definition label. Callers that
 * know the scope of what they render pass it; omitting it keeps the historical
 * lookup of `bonusLabel` for call sites that predate scope-aware display. An
 * explicit `null` - a persisted result whose scope was not recorded - uses the
 * generic Master type + rank label instead of guessing a scope.
 *
 * Each chip is colour-coded by its Bonus Type family and emphasised when its
 * rank is EX (`restorationBonusPresentation.ts`). That is a secondary cue on
 * top of the unchanged text label; a Bonus Type without a known family keeps
 * the standard Chip style. The family and the EX flag are also exposed as
 * `data-bonus-tone` / `data-bonus-ex`, so tests can read the applied category
 * without depending on colour values.
