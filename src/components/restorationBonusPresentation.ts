/**
 * Presentation-only colour coding of restoration bonus slots (Issue #69,
 * `docs/UI_FLOW.md` 3.4).
 *
 * A tone is a display family of the Bonus Type: it makes the five slots
 * easier to tell apart at a glance and carries no Domain meaning. The text
 * label stays the authority - `RestorationBonusSlots` never changes it - so
 * colour is only a secondary cue, and an EX rank - already named by the `EX`
 * text of its label - is set apart only by a slightly stronger tint.
 *
 * The family is resolved from the stable `bonusTypeId`, never from a display
 * name. Normal-side and Gogma-side types of one meaning share a family, so a
 * converted weapon's inherited normal-scope slots read like the Gogma slots
 * that replace them. A `bonusTypeId` outside this table gets no tone: the
 * caller keeps the standard Chip style instead of guessing a family from the
 * ID text.
