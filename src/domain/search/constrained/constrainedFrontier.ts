/**
 * The lazy off-axis Cross frontier of SEARCH_SPEC 5.6.7 (B8-B1b).
 *
 * One `(Route base, stream category predicate)` matrix owns a lattice whose
 * cell `(i, j)` is the pair `(B(c)[i], K(c)[j])`. The initial Search composes
 * only `i = 0` or `j = 0` (5.5.4); constrained enumeration may additionally
 * reach `i > 0 && j > 0`, capped by `maxOffAxisPairEvaluations`.
 *
 * The lattice is never materialized. Cells are discovered by expanding a popped
 * cell into `(i + 1, j)` and `(i, j + 1)` only, so the live frontier stays
 * `O(seeds + popped cells)` rather than `O(|B| x |K|)`, and no array, Set or
 * Map is ever sized by the Cartesian product.
 *
 * A single-seed lazy lattice only reproduces true best-first order if the work
 * priority is coordinate-wise monotone: moving right or down must never produce
 * a strictly better cell than the one it was discovered from. Otherwise a
 * higher-priority cell would still be invisible while a lower-priority one is
 * popped, which a consumer stopping after the first Candidate, or a small
 * off-axis cap, would turn into a wrong selection. A binary heap alone does not
 * give that property; the comparator below is what does, by following the two
 * canonical stream orderings coordinate by coordinate.
 */

/**
 * The Engine-free semantic cost of one cell, used only to order traversal.
 *
 * Every field is derived from the Route base and the two already-solved stream
 * solutions, so a cell can be ranked before it is composed or evaluated. The
 * leading fields mirror the existing Candidate ordering priorities
 * (`compareCandidateSelection`, SEARCH_SPEC 8) so a near off-axis cell can
 * outrank a distant axis cell; the trailing `bonus*` and `skill*` fields
 * reproduce the canonical stream orderings of 5.5.3 and 5.5.2 exactly, which is
 * what keeps the comparator monotone along each lattice axis.

/**
 * The deterministic best-first traversal order.
 *
 * Coordinate-wise monotonicity, which the single-seed lazy lattice depends on:
 *
 * - Along the Bonus axis (`i` fixed skill, `i -> i + 1`) the child is the next
 *   solution in `compareBonusSolutions()` order. Its key 1, `gogmaAdvance`, is
 *   compared here as `operationCount` and `gogmaAdvance`; its key 2,
 *   `matchedIdealBonusCount` descending, is compared as `idealCloseness`
 *   descending, which with the Skill side fixed is exactly that quantity; and
 *   its keys 3 to 6 are compared as `bonusMaterialQuantity`, `bonusKey`,
 *   `bonusOperationTypeKey` and `bonusScope`, in that same order and with the
 *   same numeric-versus-string semantics. So the first field where parent and
 *   child differ always ranks the parent first.
 * - Along the Skill axis (`j -> j + 1`) the child is the next solution in
 *   `compareSkillSolutions()` order. Its key 1, `resetCount`, is compared as
 *   `operationCount` and `skillAdvance`; its key 2, `idealCloseness`
 *   descending, is compared as `idealCloseness` with the Bonus side fixed; and
 *   its key 3 is compared as `skillSemanticKey`. Every `bonus*` field ties.
 * - `categoryRank` is the one leading field a later index can improve, and it
 *   can do so on EITHER axis of a Practical matrix. Along the Bonus axis, a
 *   deeper Bonus solution may satisfy Ideal while an earlier one is Practical
 *   only, with the fixed Skill solution already Ideal. Along the Skill axis, a
 *   later Skill solution may satisfy Ideal while an earlier one is Practical
 *   only, with the fixed Bonus solution already Ideal. The safety argument is
 *   the same for both: `categoryRank` reaches 0 only when the Bonus AND the
 *   Skill solution both satisfy Ideal, so that very actual pair is also a cell
 *   of the same base's Ideal matrix. Every cell of an Ideal matrix has rank 0,
 *   because both of its axes hold Ideal solutions only, so the whole Ideal
 *   matrix pops before any rank 1 cell. A rank-improving node in the Practical
 *   matrix is therefore not a hidden high-priority Candidate: it is the same
 *   actual pair the Ideal matrix already reached, and by then an evaluated
 *   duplicate.
 *
 * - `preferredSourceRank` is a property of the Route base, so every cell of one
 *   matrix carries the same value. Parent and child therefore always tie on it
 *   and the comparison falls through to the next field exactly as it did before
 *   the field existed: it can never make a child outrank its parent, and it
 *   leaves the whole argument above untouched. It only ever separates cells of
 *   different bases, which is precisely its purpose.
 *
 * The last four comparisons only separate frontier nodes that denote the same
 * actual pair in different matrices, so they never reorder delivered
 * Candidates. Ranking an axis cell before an identical off-axis cell also
 * guarantees that a pair reachable on any axis is evaluated as axis work and
 * never consumes the off-axis budget.
 *
 * `preferredSourceRank` sits after every Candidate quality and cost comparison
 * and immediately before the stable `semanticKey`, mirroring where the ordinary
 * Search comparators place the same preference (`docs/SEARCH_SPEC.md` 8.1). It
 * is a lexicographic step, never a weight, so it can never reverse a cheaper or
 * better Route. This position is what makes the preference reach the streaming
 * `visitConstrainedCandidates()` delivery order the Production Planner consumes,
 * rather than only the final array sort of `enumerateConstrainedCandidates()`.
 *
 * No run-dependent value participates: no random ID, Clock, Candidate ID, Map
 * insertion order, Promise settlement order, or enumeration ordinal. `i`, `j`
 * and `matrixIndex` decide nothing about Candidate delivery priority; they are
 * only the last internal-node tie-break.
