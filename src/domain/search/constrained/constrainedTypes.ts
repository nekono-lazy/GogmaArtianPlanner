/**
 * The Production enumeration bounds, decided by the B8-B2 real Browser Worker
 * benchmark and by nothing else.
 *
 * `docs/B8_CONSTRAINED_ENUMERATION_BROWSER_WORKER_BENCHMARK.md` holds the raw
 * measurements. The tuple was measured as a whole on the combined workload -
 * every currently legal Route base with both streams active and no Ideal
 * nearby - not assembled by adding single-axis numbers together. Every figure
 * below is a direct Worker wall-clock reading, taken in the benchmark's
 * `timing` mode - a minimal recorder that does no parity instrumentation - with
 * nothing subtracted:
 *
 * ```text
 * full bounded enumeration   median 1782.0 ms   (5 measurements)
 * time to first Candidate    median  331.6 ms
 * consumer stop after 50     median  354.6 ms
 * ```
 *
 * The axes are priced very differently in that shape, which is why the tuple is
 * not balanced. The off-axis budget is nearly free, so it is set high, and
 * Gogma - the most expensive axis - was raised from 25 to 30 by spending Normal
 * forge count. Raising Gogma further to 35 also fits, but measured worse on
 * this fixture, which is why it was not taken:
 *
 * ```text
 * 40/30/100/500   1782.0 ms   ~218 ms of headroom   20,306 candidates
 * 30/35/100/500   1899.0 ms   ~101 ms of headroom   20,178 candidates
 * ```
 *
 * The chosen tuple is faster, holds slightly more candidates, and leaves more
 * headroom for session and machine variability. As an auxiliary reason, the
 * Gogma Counter is a shared resource Planner conflicts are fought over while a
 * Normal Counter is per weapon type - but B8-B2 measured no search-quality
 * threshold, so no bound value here is a claim about what is practically
 * sufficient.
 *
 * This is a default, not a capability. Every bound stays caller-supplied: B8-C
 * and B8-D pass this constant explicitly, and `ConstrainedCandidateSearchInput`
 * keeps `bounds` required so no caller can silently inherit it. The three
 * Planner orchestration bounds are deliberately absent - they are decided in
 * B8-E, from a separate benchmark.
