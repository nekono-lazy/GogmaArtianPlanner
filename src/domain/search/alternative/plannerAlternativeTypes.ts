 * - Normal 4: a fixed Route's production target can hold and block the Normal
 *   origin, so an extent of 1 cannot move the losing Target's own production
 *   target to a later position. 4 is the smallest measured value above 1
 *   (Issue #101: about 2.8 s / 1.2 GB) and stays far from the measured
 *   16 (about 11 s / 4 GB) and 40 (V8 out of memory). It is a design choice
 *   for short held / blocked chains, not a guarantee for an arbitrarily long one.
 * - Gogma 235: the measured Issue #101 threshold (220 finds no Candidate; 235
 *   finds the Fire Alternative; 240 / 300 / 350 add no known semantic benefit).
 * - Skill 4: the Skill window is `origin .. origin + M - 1` for an existing
 *   Gogma's Reset Skills and `origin .. origin + M` for a conversion Route, so
 *   even M = 1 lets a conversion move to origin + 1 (Issue #101 converts at 342
 *   past a held and blocked 341). M = 1 is still too narrow for an existing
 *   Gogma's Reset Skills past a blocked origin, and for a conversion Route
 *   crossing a held / blocked chain beyond origin + 1. 4 is small headroom for
 *   short chains; no semantic benefit of a larger value was observed.
 *
 * Callers explicitly pass it (for example as a spread copy); it is never an
 * implicit Domain fallback, a field-completion target or a clamp.
