/**
 * Failure modes of the shared deterministic materializer

 *
 * Phase 6-B2a moved this module from the legacy B8-C2 materializer
 * (`../constrained/constrainedMaterializationErrors`, kept as a compatibility
 * facade until Phase 6-B2b) without changing its runtime contract: the one
 * constructor is still `ConstrainedMaterializationError`, so a thrown error
 * keeps its `instanceof`, its `name` / `constructor.name`
 * (`'ConstrainedMaterializationError'`), its `code` and its message.
 * `PlannerMaterializationError` is the neutral alias of that very constructor,
 * never a second class.
 *
 * Every failure fails closed: no partially built Candidate, no fallback to a
 * random ID, and no overwrite of an existing BuildListEntry. The caller reads
 * `code`, never the message text.
