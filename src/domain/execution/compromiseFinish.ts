 * The boundary is the *tracked weapon*, not the Plan's overall progress:
 * confirming another Entry's Step on another weapon leaves this weapon, and so
 * this checkpoint, exactly where it was. Every current Execution operation that
 * names a tracked weapon changes that weapon's persisted state - a
 * production-target Normal registration, a conversion, the three amendments and
 * an owned Ideal confirmation alike - while a Counter-advance Normal creation
 * tracks no weapon at all, so matching on `trackedOwnedWeaponId` needs no
 * operation-type list that a later operation could make stale.
